# Advanced Enchants

Most are familiar with the plugin **Advanced Enchantments**, but if you're not, Advanced Enchantments add 200+ custom enchants to allow players to get very creative with their items. For more information, check out the official plugin [wiki](https://ae.advancedplugins.net).&#x20;

## Enchanter

The Enchanter is who you speak with to trade XP for different enchantment books. You have the options to trade for a Simple, Unique, Elite, Ultimate, Legendary, or Heroic enchantment. These range in different XP costs. When trading XP for an enchantment, you will be rewarded with a **random** enchantment book for the rarity chosen. For example, a simple enchantment will provide you with a random simple enchantment book. For a complete list of enchantments and their rarity head on over to [enchants](enchants.md).

You can open the Enchanter GUI by right clicking the NPC located in spawn or running command **/enchanter**.

## Tinkerer

The Tinkerer is designed to turn unwanted books into secret dust that will increase the **success rate** for enchantment books. You will be given secret dust that will increase the success rate for the matching rarity. For example, if you turn an unwanted simple enchantment book, you will be rewarded with simple secret dust that can **only** be used to increase the success rate on a different **simple** enchantment book.\

You can open the Tinkerer GUI by right clicking the NPC located in spawn or running command **/tinkerer**.

## Alchemist

The Alchemist is used to combine dust and enchantment books for better rates and enchantments. For example, you can combine two **SPEED I** enchantment books to create a **SPEED II** enchantment book. Another example would be combining two of the same rarity dusts to combine & increase the success rate.&#x20;

You can open the Alchemist GUI by right clicking the NPC located in spawn or running command **/alchemist**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Enchantment books have a **success** and **destroy** rate. If applying the enchantment is unsuccessful, **the item you were attempting to enchant will be destroyed**.\
\
If you want to be completely certain the enchantment will be applied, make sure the enchantment book has a **success rate of 100%**.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Items

### White Scroll

When applied,  this scroll prevents an item from being destroyed if an enchantment fails.

### Black Scroll

This scroll removes 1 enchantment from an item and converts it into a 100% success rate enchantment book.

### Transmog Scroll

This scroll organizes enchantments by rarity on an item and adds the lore count to the name.

### Holy White Scroll

When applied, this scroll protects your armor, weapons, or tools from being dropped on death. Essentially, the item is soulbound.

{% hint style="info" %}
After death, you need to apply another holy white scroll to prevent the item from being dropped.
{% endhint %}

### MobTrak Creator

When applied, tracks the amount of mobs killed with the weapon.

### BlockTrak Creator

When applied, track how many blocks have been broken with a tool.

### Item Name Tag

Rename and customize your equipment.

### Magic Dust

Magic dust is used to increase the success rates of enchantment books. Magic dusts can only be applied to the same rarity enchantment book. For example, you can not apply simple magic dust to a unique enchantment book. Refer to the gif below on how to apply the dust to the enchantment book.
