# Cyber Set (Purple)

All cyber weapons, tools, & armor are unbreakable and match the default stats of netherite tools, weapons, & armor.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
When hovering over the armor with hidden tips enabled, it will show that the armor is leather. This is a limitation with custom armor and will always show as leather. However we have the ability to customize the stats of the armor. Though it shows as leather, it has the same protection/stats as netherite armor.&#x20;
