# Aging

This is the place to learn how to age the brew you have created so far. The third and final step for most brews. This is the part where you have to pay attention the most because if you leave the brew inside of the barrel for too long it turns into "murky bottle". Depending on brew you will have to leave your bottles inside the barrels for a specific time. Note that the barrel aging timeline is different than the time in game and in real life.&#x20;

### How to Age the Brew

To age the brew that you have created, click on the barrel that the brew requires to be aged in for example certain brews need to be aged in an oak barrel, or a dark oak barrel. Make sure to double check brewery recipes before you put the bottles into the barrel. If you put a brew into a barrel that is not meant for the brew you have created you may create a murky brew or a different type of brew. **Be sure to keep an eye on your brew, check on it from time to time because the aging timeline is different from in real life time and minecraft time.**&#x20;
