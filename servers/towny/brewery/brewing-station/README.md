## Cauldron

First and foremost, you will need the **cauldron** to cook the ingredients like a witch. No kidding. Over an infinite fire because we absolutely do not want the fire to go out every few seconds while you are cooking, it will clear the progress. So you will need a block of **netherrack,** and a set of **flint and steel** to light up the netherrack for infinite fire. Also make sure your area is not super flammable, we do not want your workspace to burn down while you are cooking.&#x20;

#### How to Make a Cauldron:&#x20;

You will need **seven** **iron ingots** to make a cauldron. To obtain **seven iron ingots**, you will need to mine seven iron ores and smelt them using furnace or the blast furnace. _(Note: Blast furnace smelts things faster however it will cost more fuel.)_ Click on the crafting table and place the iron ingots into the crafting table  in a "U" shape, alternatively you can also use the "green crafting book" in the crafting menu game interface. You may also buy a cauldron in the shop menu under the "Brewing" tab as well. To get to the shop menu do the /shop command in game.

#### How to Make Flint and Steel:

You will need **one iron ingot** and **one flint**. To obtain iron ingot you will need to mine one iron ore, then smelt it in a furnace or a blast furnace _(Note: Blast furnace smelts things faster however it will cost more fuel.)_ To __ obtain flint you will need to dig gravel till you get flint. Then click on the crafting table to craft your flint, place the iron ingot and flint diagonally from each other like you are making a slash note that the iron ingot will be one block higher than flint. Alternatively you can also use the "green crafting book" in the crafting menu game interface.&#x20;

#### How to Obtain/Light Up Netherrack:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-03-13 at 3.27.03 PM.png>)

You will need **one netherrack** under your cauldron, but have **one block of air (empty space) between the cauldron and the netherrack** so you can light up the netherrack for infinite fire. If you do not have an infinite fire going and the fire goes out every few seconds the cauldron will not cook/ferment the brew.

&#x20;To obtain **netherrack** you have to build a nether portal to access the nether. To make a nether portal you will need a total of **fourteen obsidian blocks**, use **flint and steel** to light up the portal. If you are in the server you may use /rtp and click the netherrack in the rtp menu, you may also buy netherrack in the shop menu under the "blocks" tab. To get to the shop menu do the /shop command in game.

To obtain **obsidian blocks** for the nether portal, you will need a bucket of water to pour on top of lava. You will need to build the portal by placing fourteen obsidian blocks into a four by five rectangle leaving a two by three airspace in the middle. The portal must be standing up and facing you. The portal will not work if you build it into the floor. Then light up the portal using **flint and steel** right click the portal to light the portal up then step into it to head into the nether.

**TIP:** If you want to have multiple blocks of obsidian, you will need to pour the water one block above lava, do not pour directly on top of lava, you will need to gather more water.

## Water Bucket

You will need a **water** **bucket** to fill your cauldron to start cooking your ingredients to make the brew. Without the **water bucket** the cooking process will not start.&#x20;

#### How to Make a Water Bucket:

You will need **three** **iron ingots** to make a bucket to fill with water. To obtain **three iron ingots**, you will need to mine three iron ores and smelt them using furnace or the blast furnace. _(Note: Blast furnace smelts things faster however it will cost more fuel.)_ Click on the crafting table and place the iron ingots into the crafting table  in a "V" shape, alternatively you can also use the "green crafting book" in the crafting menu game interface. &#x20;

#### How to Fill a Bucket With Water:

Right click a body of water or a block of water to fill your empty bucket with water to put into the cauldron. This will be used to cook/ferment your ingredients for the brew.&#x20;

**TIP:** To make a infinite pool of water you need a 2x2 area for water 1 block deep, fill the 2x2 with water diagonally for example if you fill the upper right corner with water, fill the lower left corner with water and you will have a infinite pool of water and no longer need to walk to a body of water every time you need water to brew.

## Clock

You will need **a clock** in order to start cooking your brew. It will tell you how many minutes your cauldron has been cooking/fermenting. If you do not use a clock you will not start the cooking/fermenting process of creating a brew.

#### How to Make a Clock:

To make a clock you will need **four gold ingots** and **one redstone dust**. Right click the crafting table and put the four gold ingots into a diamond shape in the crafting table gui, then one redstone dust in the middle of the gold ingot diamond shape, alternatively you can also use the "green crafting book" in the crafting menu game interface. If you are in the server you may use /rtp and click the stone block to head into the resource world in the rtp menu, you may also buy ores in the shop menu under the "ores" tab. To get to the shop menu do the /shop command in game.

## Bottles

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/ZmoWfHpB2iiYdZTtHo/giphy.gif)

You will need a **bottle or Bottles** to fill with for your drink. (_Note: bowls will not work for this.)_ This will let you be able to distill or age your drink. This also will let you drink your brew or share with others of the community.

#### How to Make Bottles:

You will need **three glass blocks** to make a bottle to fill with for your brew. You will need to dig three sand blocks and smelt them with a furnace or a blast furnace _(Note: Blast furnace smelts things faster however it will cost more fuel.)_ Click a crafting table and put the glass in a "V" shape just like the same as a bucket. Alternatively you can also use the "green crafting book" in the crafting menu game interface. If you are in the server you may also buy the bottles in the shop menu under the "Brewing" tab. To get to the shop menu do the /shop command in game.

## Brewing Stand

The Brewing stand is essential to distilling the brew. Most recipes require you to distill  the brew to make it alcoholic. You will need blaze powder and glowstone dust to power and start the distilling process.&#x20;

#### How to Make a Brewing Stand:

You will need one **blaze rod** and **three cobblestone** to make a brewing stand. To get a blaze rod you will need to head into the nether and find a nether fortress. It will look like dark purple bricks built into a shape of a bridge most of the time. You will find blazes there. Please note that blazes can be quite difficult to defeat because they tend to fly and throw fire balls at you, so remember to gear up before you venture out! To get cobblestone simply mine stone in the over world. If you are in the server you may use /rtp and click the stone block to head into the resource world in the rtp menu, you may also buy the brewing stand in the shop menu under the "Brewing" tab. To get to the shop menu do the /shop command in game.

To get to the shop menu do the /shop command in game.
