### Barrel Block

**Barrel Blocks** are special in this case, the barrel block can act like a regular barrel but in a compact form that only holds **six bottles of brew**, if you attempt to place more brews into barrel the barrel block will reject and not let you place the seventh brew inside of it. _**(Note: This Barrel is still under experimentation and results may vary.)**_&#x20;

**Note:** Both require **a sign** that is placed on the barrel with the word "**Barrel**" (without quotations) typed on the first line of the sign (no matter what type of sign as long as it is not an item frame.) in order to turn the blocks into a working barrel. If done right, there should be a message saying a "barrel was created".
