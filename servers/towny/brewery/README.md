Bored of the same ol' potions in vanilla Minecraft? Need some spunk or a nice kick with your drink? Master the art of brewing your alcohol in game through cooking/fermenting, distilling, and aging your drink. Pull up a chair or two share some drinks over a campfire or on a high mountain top. Sell, trade, or gift your best brews with members in the community!&#x20;

## Features:&#x20;

* Ability to brew alcoholic drinks or non-alcoholic drinks
* Ability to get drunk in game with alcoholic drinks
* Non-alcoholic drinks gives boosts (for example: haste, strength)
* Your chat becomes "drunk" (for example: \*burp\* or \*hic\*)
* Experience Nausea (puking soul sand), your character shuffling around doing the drunk walk, or blindness
* Share drinks with best buds in game!&#x20;
* Quality of brews

### What is Quality?&#x20;

Quality in each brew has a rating of zero to five stars, five being the highest quality. The quality of the brew determines how drunk your in game character will be.&#x20;

**Tip:** If you need to talk in chat while you are drunk, use " \* " for example: **\*I need milk and some bread please\***
