# Curing Hangovers/Drunkenness

Want to stop being drunk? Sick of stumbling around with nausea in game? You have come to the right place. When you want to stop being drunk in game you will need bread and buckets of milk. So make sure you have a bunch of wheat and one cow nearby. There will be a bar on top of your hot bar showing your percentage/level of drunkenness when you eat bread, or drink milk.&#x20;

### How to Make Bread

You will need **three wheat**, click on the crafting table as if you are crafting a slab. (So it will be three wheat placed on the same row horizontal.)



### Effects of Being Drunk in game

* Sluggish movement
* Nausea
* Character shuffling around by itself even if you are not pressing any movement keys (unable to walk straight)
* Blindness
* Poison
* Slurred speech in chat, sometimes making \*Burp\* or \*Hic\* noises in chat
* Vomiting soul sand
* Over-drinking can cause character to "black out" meaning disconnecting from server and when logging back on you may wake up in a different place from where you disconnected.&#x20;
