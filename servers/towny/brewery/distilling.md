# Distilling

Distilling is a process that makes your brew into alcohol. Note that all brews do not require to be distilled. If you accidentally distill a brew that is not meant to be distilled it may turn into "murky distilled water". If you accidentally distilled over the required distilled time you may also change the alcohol level, or the quality of the brew.&#x20;

### How to Distill:

You will need to put the three bottles of brew that you have bottled up by right clicking the brewing stand, click and drag the three bottles from your inventory putting them into the bottom three squares, put blaze powder in the upper left box to power the brewing stand, then glowstone powder on the upper middle square to start the distillation process. Note that the glowstone powder will act as a filter and will not dissolve into the bottles. Keep an eye on the arrow loading downwards. That will show the progress of filtering. If the arrow is not loading downwards click any one of the bottles that you have placed into the brewing stand to start it up. You can also see what happens to your brew by hovering your cursor over the three bottles. It will show amount of alc (alcohol), how many times it has been distilled and also the quality of the brew. Note that the name of the brew has a chance of changing.
