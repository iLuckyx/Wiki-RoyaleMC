# Cooking/Fermenting

This is the cooking/fermenting part of the guide. You will need a **cauldron with an infinite fire** under the cauldron and the cauldron filled with water to cook/ferment your ingredients with. You will also need a **clock** to check how long the cauldron has been brewing because some brews require to be fermented/cooked for a certain amount of time. Lastly you will need **bottles** to draw the brew from your cauldron.&#x20;

### How to Put Ingredients Into Cauldron:

To put your required ingredients into a cauldron to start brewing you will need your cauldron filled with water then hold onto the required ingredient and right click the cauldron with it. If you do not put the number of required ingredients into the cauldron the brew will turn into another brew or just "murky water".

### How to Bottle the Brew:

We are now done cooking/fermenting the brew, next up we will need to bottle the brew for distilling, aging, or simply just to share with your friends. You will need **three bottles** to draw the brew from the cauldron. Each cauldron will only hold enough for three bottles. Right click the cauldron with an empty bottle in your hand to fill it up.
