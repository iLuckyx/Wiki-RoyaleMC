# Auction House

The auction house is exactly what is sounds like. It's a house full of items being auctioned off by players within the community. To view what is currently being auctioned off, run command **/ah**.&#x20;

## How to Auction an Item

While holding the item in you hand, type command **/ah sell \<price>**. For example, /ah sell 5000 will auction off whatever item you were holding at the time of entering the command for $5,000 in-game money.&#x20;

## Removing an Auctioned Item

Select the **Current Listings** (diamond) within the Auction House GUI. This will provide you with a GUI of all your current listed items. Click the item you want to remove from being auctioned.\
