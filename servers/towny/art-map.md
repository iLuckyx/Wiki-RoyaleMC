# Art Map

ArtMap allows players to create and share unique artwork in-game using an easel, canvas, and paint. For more information, refer to the developer's official [wiki](https://gitlab.com/BlockStack/ArtMap/-/wikis/home).

Access the ArtMap main menu by running command **`/art` ** while logged into the server.&#x20;

## Getting Started

Place an Easel by right-clicking on the ground. Once you mount your Canvas on the Easel, you can right-click to ride the Easel and begin painting.

To paint, click the Canvas with different dyes. Right-click and drag to draw lines and curves. You can also click with a Paint Bucket to fill in an area.

Press shift to dismount, or use **/artmap save** to save and retrieve your artwork. You can use the [commands](art-map.md#commands) to delete artworks or view other players' work. Use **`/artmap`** in-game for more information.

{% hint style="info" %}
All ranks above **Citizen** are given an "art kit" when sitting at the easel. This means that when sitting at the easel your inventory will change to containing all of the art supplies you would ever need. From fill buckets to all of the colors. Once you leave the easel your inventory will revert back to the inventory you had prior to sitting down.
