### What is Entropy?

Entropy is used as the plugins custom currency. You earn this in many forms and is used to craft augments and upgrade your deliveries in **** /fish deliveries.

Entropy **** is essential to your entire experience within fishing. Without it, you cannot upgrade your deliveries or craft augments.

### How much Entropy will I get for catching and gutting?

### The totem, what is it?

The Totem requires you to be fishing level 50 to unlock. It is a multi-block structure that allows you to get special effects based upon a time limit, also having a cooldown. Once you have built the structure after unlocking, you must right click the first observer block with a fishing rod in order to access the Totem GUI. \
\
In addition to that, there are lots of upgrades for the totem, so I'll be going through each one:\
\
<mark style="color:red;">Totem Radius:</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;"></mark>This upgrades the range of the totem's effects/abilities, it has a max level of 5 and costs 150,000 Entropy for the first upgrade. \
\
<mark style="color:red;">Active Time:</mark> This upgrades the duration of the totem's effects/abilities, it has a max level of 20 and costs 125,000 Entropy for the first upgrade.\
\
<mark style="color:red;">Cooldown Reduction:</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;"></mark>This decreases the cooldown between each usage of the totem, it has a max level of 7 and costs 175,000 Entropy for the first upgrade.\
\
<mark style="color:red;">Passive Slots:</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;"></mark>This increases the number of passive slots you can allocate to your passives, this upgrade does not state a max level. \
\
<mark style="color:red;">Mythical Waters (Passive):</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;"></mark>When fishing within the range of the totem this will give a chance for the fish to be upscaled, similar to the old Tsunami augment.\
\
<mark style="color:red;">Experienced Fisherman (Passive):</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;"></mark>This will increase the amount of fishing experience you receive while fishing within the range of the totem. \
\
<mark style="color:red;">Fish Schools (Passive):</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;"></mark>This will cause the augment Hot Spot to activate more frequently as long as you have it on your fishing rod, while fishing within the range of the totem. \
\
<mark style="color:red;">Little Critters (Passive):</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;"></mark>This will give you a higher chance to get crab loot from killing crabs within the range of the totem. \
\
<mark style="color:red;">Treasure Hunter (Passive):</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;"></mark>This will give you a chance to find a range of random items while fishing within the range of the totem. \
\
<mark style="color:red;">Star Fall (Passive):</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;"></mark>This will give you a chance to create a lightning bold that summons a strong fish, you must kill it to be rewarded with loot and entropy. \
\
<mark style="color:red;">Entropy Hoarder (Passive):</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;"></mark>This will give you more entropy from catching fish within the range of the totem. \
\
<mark style="color:red;">Random Drops (Passive):</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;"></mark>This will give you a chance of getting other fishing loot (including custom mob drops) from killing crabs. \
\
<mark style="color:red;">Click to Activate:</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;"></mark>This button will inform you of your current active time, cooldown, and radius of the totem upon hovering over it. \
\
**What are Passive upgrades?**\
****Passive upgrades are upgrades for the totem that require a certain level, amount of Passive slots, that further give higher effects. Unlike the normal upgrades, you do not have to go into the menu to purchase them, as they will be upgraded once you meet the requirements for each one. Passive effects only work when the totem is active, and do not function when the totem is in cooldown. Also note that you are able to break the Totem and rebuild it elsewhere, this will save your data and give you a special item that will allow you to place it back down again without having to pay the price for it a second time.

_Crabs:_ Crabs are silverfish that can be fished up while fishing at a base chance of 5% (Without Crab Bait)\
