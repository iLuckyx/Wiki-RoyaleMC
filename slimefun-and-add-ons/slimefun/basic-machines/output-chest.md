# Output Chest

## Description

The Output Chest is a key [Basic Machine](./) within Slimefun. The Output Chest appears as a normal chest, but when placed adjacent to a dispenser that is part of another Basic Machine, it will collect the crafted items.&#x20;

## Usage

Place the Output Chest adjacent to a Dispenser that is part of a Slimefun [Basic Machine](./). Use the Basic Machine to craft items and then crafted items will output into the Output Chest. Below are two examples of crafting the [Grandmas Walking Stick](../weapons/grandmas-walking-stick.md) using the [Enhanced Crafting Table](enhanced-crafting-table.md). The examples outline the difference between when an Output Chest is being used VS when it is not.
