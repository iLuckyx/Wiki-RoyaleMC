## Usage

Start by placing your items in the correct pattern (recipe) for the item you're planning on crafting within the Dispenser. Next, with the items in the correct pattern inside the Dispenser, right click the Crafting Table. If the recipe is correct, fire particles will appear above the crafting table. Once the particles stop, the crafted item will appear within the Dispenser. If the recipe is incorrect, you will obtain a warning in chat letting you know the recipe was not recognized.
