## Features

### Candy Basket Spawn Hunt & Candy Collector

Starting from **Oct 29th at 3 PM EST** the candy collector will come and leave his candy baskets around spawn for players to find. Each basket found will reward 1 piece of candy for a total of 40 over 8 different kinds. Find all 40 candy baskets to be rewarded and instant **5** event crate keys. Don't get rid of your candy! Find the candy collector at his van to trade for a handful of different rewards. Choose your rewards wisely as you only get to pick them once!&#x20;

### Brew Master & Halloween Brews

We have put together a handful of new brews for everyone to get making! Make x3 of each new Halloween-themed drink and hand them in to the Brew Master to unlock a witch pouch. The witch pet pouch has a chance to win 1 of 3 different style witch pets. Get started by using command `/recipes` and get brewing those new recipes. If you need help with brewery, use command `/wiki brew` within game or click [here](https://wiki.royale-mc.com/servers/towny/brewery). Once you're ready to hand in your brews for a witch pet pouch, run command `/brewmaster`.

### Pyro Mining Event

This part of the event has nothing to do with us and is within the plugin itself but since it is active on RoyaleMC we figured it's best to share the info. All the info can be found at: [https://pyrotempus.gitbook.io/pyro-plugins/pyromining/the-unkown-halloween](https://pyrotempus.gitbook.io/pyro-plugins/pyromining/the-unkown-halloween)
