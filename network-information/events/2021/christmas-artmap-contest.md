## Artmap Contest

This Christmas we are going to host another Artmap contest as a handful of community members enjoyed the event and the results were amazing! If you're interested in participating in this event, continue reading for all the details on how to enter, when it ends, and what the winners will obtain.

If you are familiar with Art Map and how it works, please click [here](../../../servers/towny/art-map.md) to review our guide on how to get started creating your first art piece.&#x20;

### How to Enter **& Win**

Start by making a Christmas-themed art masterpiece. When saving your final art masterpiece simply save it with CE in the front of the title_._ For example `/artmap save CE_<artwork title>`.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Players are allowed only **one** entry. Any players with multiple entries/artwork save with CE\_ in the front will be disqualified. This means your masterpiece must fit within one map so plan accordingly.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to run the save command, players need to be sitting at the easel they want to enter.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The best way to win is by creating the best art you can on **one single map** that is Christmas-themed!
