## Art Map Contest

This Halloween we are going to try a new contest we have never tried before. As you can tell by the title of this section, that is correct a Halloween Art Map contest. If you're interested in participating in this event, continue reading for all the details on how to enter, when it ends, and what the winners will obtain.

### How to Enter **& Win**

Start by making a Halloween art masterpiece. When saving your final art masterpiece simply save it with HE in the front of the title_._ For example `/artmap save HE_<artwork title>`. Players are allowed only **one** entry. Any players with multiple entries/artwork save with HE\_ in the front will be disqualified.&#x20;

In order to run the save command, players need to be sitting at the easel they want to enter.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The best way to win is by creating the best art you can on **one single map** that is Halloween-themed!&#x20;
