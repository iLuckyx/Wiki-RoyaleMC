## Writing Reviews

Writing reviews & providing us with feedback helps the community in a few different ways. One way it helps is that it provides users looking for a new server to play on an understanding & what they can expect to find / get out of the server even before they ever join. Another way is that it helps the community grow. Some vote sites use activity and review metrics into the server score. Below are a few of the many sites you can find us on and leave a review. \

Just like voting, this is not required but if you want to help the community without spending money, these are the best ways.&#x20;
